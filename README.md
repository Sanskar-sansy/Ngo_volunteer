# Ngo_volunteer
NGO-Volunteer Connect is a web-based platform designed to bridge the gap between Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and passionate volunteers. This system allows volunteers to explore and apply for NGO initiatives that match their interests and skills, while enabling NGOs to select volunteers based on qualifications and requirements.
